# Tasks

A small C application for managing personal tasks in some repositories.

The application and its documentation are still under development.

Once releases are available, they are _passable_ applications and are ready to download.
It is recommended to use `git clone` for downloading.

Make sure to have `make` installed on the local machine.

Create and checkout to a directory for cloning the application.

```
git clone git://github.com/falling-leaves/mini-tasks.git
make && make install
```
